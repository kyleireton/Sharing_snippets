# R

# this is a little how-to snippet for the force-directed graph visualization I shared in this tweet:

# the idea is to visualize a distance matrix, to understand which values are closest to every other in a set

# we'll use qgraph to draw the graphics, and maybe data.table to rename columns
# stats is for the original distance matrix. I think it comes w/ base R

library(qgraph)
library(data.table)
library(stats)

# first, compute the distance matrix for all values in one column of your data

distmat = as.matrix(
  
  stats::dist(your_data$key_column,
       
       upper=TRUE,
       
       diag=TRUE)
)

# Now, take the "inverse" so we can use force-directed graph drawing


dist_mi <- 1/distmat # "one over", as qgraph takes similarity matrices as input


# In my data, I wanted to rename the columns with better labels
# this is situational. I pulled in the names from a column in another dataframe
# so only do this if you want different labels in your force-graph drawing


data.table::setnames(as.data.frame(dist_mi),
         
         new = as.character((other_dataframe$new_variable_labels)))


# finally, we just draw the force-directed graph drawing algorithm!

qgraph::qgraph(dist_mi,
       
       layout = 'spring',
       
       vsize = 3)
